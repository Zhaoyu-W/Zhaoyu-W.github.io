I'm currently working at [ByteDance/TikTok](https://www.bytedance.com/) as Backend Engineer in Bellevue, WA. Before joining ByteDance/TikTok, I spent a wonderful year at [Cornell Computer Scienceüêª](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/) for my *Master of Engineering* degree in Gorges Ithaca, where I was fortunately advised by [Prof. Anrew C. Myers](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/andru/) and [Prof. Immanuel Trummer](https://itrummer.github.io/).

Previously, I worked at [Booking.com](https://www.booking.com/) as Infrastructure Engineer and [Wish](https://wish.com) as Full Stack Engineer in Shanghai. During my undergraduate years, I worked as Software Engineer Intern at [Wish](https://wish.com), [Target](https://www.target.com/), and [Grab](https://www.grab.com/sg/). I obtained my *Bachelor of Science* degree from [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.umn.edu/cs) at University of Minnesota, Twin Cities in May, 2021.

**Interests:** large-scale distributed systems, cloud computing, database management systems, data infrastructure.<br>
